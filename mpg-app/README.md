# 🚗 Auto Mileage Predictor

This is a Streamlit web application that predicts the fuel efficiency (mileage) of a car based on its technical specifications. This project was built as part of an academic assignment on Automobile + Machine Learning.

## 🛠️ Project Details

This project uses a Random Forest Regressor model trained on the classic "Auto MPG" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

* **Model:** `RandomForestRegressor` (from `scikit-learn`)
* **Techniques:** The Random Forest model was chosen after comparing it to a baseline Linear Regression model. The Random Forest provided a higher $R^2$ score (better accuracy) by capturing the non-linear relationships in the data.
* **App Framework:** `Streamlit`
